             Nalasys (Natural Language System)
             
Nalasys is a natural language system that allows users to specify instructions to the computer in natural language. By defining words with intrinsic data the system recognizes, a user will be able to program a system using his own words.

For now the system can use several programmatic languages like SQL, Javascript, Groovy or JSP expression language. It also has a default language with no keywords where you can add words defined with objects in memory or from other languages.
